## Ingredients

- 3 _avocados_, pitted
- 1 small _jalapeño_, seeds removed if desired, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh _cilantro_, plus more for serving
- 1/4 cup small white or red _onion_, finely chopped
- juice of 1 _lime_
- 1/2 teaspoon (or more) _kosher salt_
- _tortilla chips_, for serving (optional)

## Directions

1. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and mash with a fork to desired consistency. Season with more salt if needed.

## Notes

- **Storage:** If you’d like to make your guac in advance (or are storing leftovers), prevent oxidation and slow down browning by pressing a layer of plastic wrap directly on top of the surface of your guacamole so that no air is touching the dip. Secure with a lid and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
