## Ingredients

- 3 *avocados*, pitted
- 1 small *jalapeño*, seeds removed if desired, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh *cilantro*, plus more for serving
- 1/4 cup small white or red *onion*, finely chopped
- juice of 1 *lime*
- 1/2 teaspoon (or more) *kosher salt*
- *tortilla chips*, for serving (optional)

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, mix avocados, jalapeño, cilantro, onion, lime juice, and salt, then slowly turn bowl as you run a fork through mixture (this will ensure guacamole stays chunky) until desired consistency is reached; season with salt, if needed.

## Notes

- **Storage:** If you’d like to make your guac in advance (or are storing leftovers), prevent oxidation and slow down browning by pressing a layer of plastic wrap directly on top of the surface of your guacamole so that no air is touching the dip. Secure with a lid and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
