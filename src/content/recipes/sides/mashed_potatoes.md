## Ingredients

- 5 lb _potatoes_ (half Yukon Gold, half Russet)
- 4-6 large cloves _garlic_, minced
- _fine sea salt_
- 6 tbsp _butter_
- 1 cup _whole milk_
- 4 oz _cream cheese_, room temperature
- chopped fresh _chives_ (optional)
- _green onions_ (optional)
- freshly-cracked _black pepper_ (optional)

## Directions

1. **Cut the potatoes.** Peel if desired, cut into even 1-inch chunks, and transfer to a large stockpot of cold water.
1. **Boil the potatoes.** Add enough cold water to cover by 1 inch. Stir in garlic and 1 tbsp sea salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to medium-high, and cook 10-12 min until a knife slides through with no resistance. Drain completely.
1. **Melt the butter mixture.** Heat butter, milk, and 2 tsp sea salt in a small saucepan or microwave until butter just melts. Don't boil the milk. Set aside.
1. **Pan-dry the potatoes.** Return drained potatoes to the hot stockpot on the burner over low heat. Shake gently for about 1 min to steam off excess moisture. Remove from heat.
1. **Mash the potatoes.** Mash to desired consistency with a potato masher or ricer.
1. **Stir everything together.** Fold in half the butter mixture with a wooden spoon until absorbed. Repeat with remaining butter, then fold in cream cheese until just combined. Add more warm milk if needed.
1. **Season and serve.** Taste and adjust salt. Serve warm with gravy or desired toppings.

## Notes

- **Potato blend:** A 50/50 mix of Yukon Gold and Russet gives the best balance of buttery flavor and fluffy texture.
- **Avoid waterlogging:** Cut potatoes before boiling for even cooking, don't overboil, and pan-dry after draining to release excess steam.
- **Don't overmix:** Fold liquids in until just combined — overmixing makes them gummy.
- **Seasoning:** Salt both the boiling water and the final mix. Taste and adjust as you go.
