## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups long grain _white rice_
- 1/4 cup _vegetable oil_
- 1 tsp _garlic_, minced
- 1/4 medium _onion_, finely diced
- 1/4 cup _tomato sauce_ (or 2 pureed tomatoes)
- 2 tsp _tomato bouillon_ (granules or cubes)
- 1/4 tsp _salt_
- 1 _carrot_, diced
- 1/2 cup _peas_ (frozen or fresh)
- 3 cups _water_
- 1-3 whole _serrano peppers_ (optional)

## Directions

1. Rinse rice in a fine mesh strainer until water runs clear.
2. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add rice and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until lightly golden, about 10 minutes.
3. Add tomato sauce, garlic, and onion. Stir. Add bouillon, salt, carrots, peas, water, and serrano peppers if using.
4. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook about 20 minutes until water is absorbed. Rest 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.

## Notes

- **Rice:** Rinse well to remove starch for fluffy results. For brown rice, add 1/2 cup more liquid and cook 40 minutes.
- **Tomato Sauce:** For a more authentic version, blend 1-2 fresh tomatoes with the onion and garlic before adding.
- **Tomato Bouillon:** Found in the Mexican aisle. Substitute chicken bouillon if unavailable.
- **Serrano Peppers:** Adds flavor without making the rice spicy.
