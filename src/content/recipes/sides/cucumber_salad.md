## Ingredients

- 1 _cucumber_ (Japanese, English, Persian, or pickling), about 1 1/2 cup sliced
- 1 tbsp _soy sauce_ (jin ganjang)
- 2 tbsp _rice vinegar_
- 1 tbsp _sugar_
- 1/2 tsp Korean _red chili powder_
- 1/4 tsp _sesame seeds_
- 2 _green onions_, chopped

## Directions

1. Slice cucumbers into thin rounds, about 1/8 inch (3 mm).
2. Mix soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar in a bowl. Pour over cucumbers.
3. Add chili powder and sesame seeds. Mix and taste; add more chili powder as needed.
4. Add green onions and toss.
5. Serve immediately for maximum crunch, or let sit 10-15 minutes to absorb the dressing.

## Notes

- **Storage:** Refrigerate for a few days and serve cold. Freshen up with green onions and sesame seeds.
- **Tip:** This is a lighter-style oi muchim, best paired with fried rice, fish, or noodles rather than heavier Korean BBQ.
