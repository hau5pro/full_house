## Ingredients

- 1 lb _zucchini_, about 3 medium
- 2 large _eggs_
- 1 1/2 cups chopped _scallions_, about 1 bunch
- 3 _garlic_ cloves, grated
- 2 tbsp chopped fresh _dill_
- 1 tbsp _lemon zest_
- 1 tsp _sea salt_
- 2 1/4 cups _panko breadcrumbs_, divided
- 3 tbsp _all-purpose flour_
- _avocado oil_, for the pan
- freshly ground _black pepper_
- _tartar sauce_ or [_creamy dill sauce_](/recipes/sauces/dill_sauce), for serving

## Directions

1. Grate zucchini on the large holes of a box grater. Place on a kitchen towel and squeeze out excess moisture.
2. Whisk eggs in a large bowl. Add zucchini, scallions, garlic, dill, lemon zest, salt, and several grinds of pepper.
3. Add 1 1/2 cups panko and the flour. Fold to combine. Place remaining 3/4 cup panko in a shallow dish.
4. Preheat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat.
5. Use a 1/4 cup measure to form 14–16 thin patties. Press each into the reserved panko to coat.
6. Coat skillet generously with oil. Cook patties 2–3 min per side until well browned, working in batches.
7. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Season to taste and serve with sauce.

## Notes

- **Texture:** The mixture will seem loose, but patties firm up as they cook.
