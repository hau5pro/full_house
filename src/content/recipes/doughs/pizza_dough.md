## Ingredients

- 400g (1 2/3 cup) _warm water_, 86F/30C
- 20g (1 1/2 tbsp) _extra virgin olive oil_
- 7g (2 tsp) _instant yeast_
- 15g (1 tbsp) _salt_
- 20g (2 tbsp) _granulated sugar_
- 680g (5 3/4 cup) _all-purpose flour_

## Directions

1. Combine warm water, olive oil, yeast, salt, and sugar. Stir in flour with a sturdy spoon until hydrated and a shaggy dough forms.

2. Wet one hand and grab-and-squeeze the dough repeatedly until smooth and homogenous.

3. Cover the bowl and ferment on the counter for 30 minutes.

4. With a wet hand, stretch a corner of the dough out and fold it back over itself. Repeat 4-5 times around the dough.

5. Flip seam-side down, round into a tight ball by tucking underneath to build tension. Cover and rest at room temperature for 60 minutes.

6. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.

7. Divide into 4 large (~280g) or 7 small (~163g) equal pieces.

8. Shape each piece by folding the sides inward, rotate 90 degrees and repeat, then flip and roll into a ball.

9. Place on an oiled baking tray, cover, and rest 15 minutes before pressing out into pizzas.

## Notes

- **Storage:** Can freeze; defrost 1-2 hours at room temp before using.
- **Cold ferment:** Refrigerate up to 3-4 days, then freeze.
