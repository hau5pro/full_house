## Ingredients

- 1 tsp _instant yeast_
- 1/2 cup _warm water_ (~105F)
- 1 tbsp _white sugar_
- 2 tbsp _whole milk_
- 1 1/2 tbsp _whisked egg_, at room temp (~half an egg)
- 1/2 tsp _kosher salt_
- 1 3/4 cups _bread flour_ (or all-purpose)
- 2 tbsp _ghee_ or _unsalted butter_, melted

**Finishes:**

- 2 tbsp _ghee_ or _butter_, melted
- 1 small _garlic_ clove, minced (for garlic butter option)
- _nigella seeds_
- _cilantro_, finely chopped

**Cheese naan:**

- 1/4 cup _shredded cheese_ per naan (monterey jack, cheddar, or colby)

## Directions

1. Mix yeast with warm water and sugar in a small bowl. Cover and let sit 10 minutes until foamy.
2. Whisk milk and egg together in a separate bowl.
3. Sift flour and salt into a large bowl.
4. Make a well in the flour. Add yeast mixture, melted butter, and egg mixture. Stir with a spatula until mostly incorporated, then bring together into a ball by hand. No kneading required.
5. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place 1-1.5 hrs until doubled.
6. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Cut into 6 equal pieces and shape into smooth balls by stretching the surface and tucking underneath.
7. Place balls on a lightly floured tray, dust with flour, and cover loosely with a tea towel. Rest 15 minutes until increased ~50% in size.
8. Flatten a ball on a lightly floured surface and roll out to 3-4mm thick (~6.5" wide).
9. Lightly oil a cast iron skillet with a paper towel. Heat over high until wisps of smoke appear.
10. Cook naan 1-1.5 minutes until the underside is deep golden and the surface is bubbly. Flip and cook 1 minute more until golden brown.
11. Repeat with remaining naan, regulating heat so the skillet doesn't overheat.
12. Brush with melted ghee or garlic butter. Sprinkle with nigella seeds and cilantro. Serve hot.

**Cheese naan:**

1. Roll out a naan per above. Brush with butter or garlic butter. Place ~1/4 cup cheese in the center, bundle up, and twist to seal.
2. Flip seam-side down and roll out to 6-7mm (~1/4") thick.
3. Cook in a hot (not smoking) cast iron skillet about 1.5 minutes per side until golden and puffed.

## Notes

- **Yeast:** Dry active yeast works too but naan won't be quite as soft. Blooming instant yeast in warm water is intentional here — it yields a softer result than adding it directly to the dough.
- **Egg:** Half an egg sounds odd but any more dries out the interior. Whisk a whole egg and measure 1 1/2 tbsp, or double the batch to use the full egg.
- **Flour:** Bread flour makes the softest naan. All-purpose works nearly as well.
- **Ghee:** Clarified butter with a richer flavor than regular butter. Store-bought or homemade both work, or substitute regular butter.
- **Garlic Butter:** Melt 2 tbsp salted butter with 1/2 tsp crushed garlic. Let sit a few minutes to infuse before brushing.
- **Cheese:** Any melting cheese works. Monterey jack has good flavor and stretch. Mozzarella melts well but is mild.
- **Proofing Tip:** A turned-off dryer is a great draft-free proofing spot — run it briefly to warm, then place the bowl inside.
- **Skillet:** If no cast iron, use another heavy skillet lightly oiled. Avoid non-stick — the high heat will damage the coating.
- **Make Ahead:** After the first rise, refrigerate the dough up to 24 hours without punching down. Bring to room temperature fully before cutting and proofing, or the second rise won't work.
- **Nutrition:** Excludes butter/ghee brushed on top and cheese filling.
