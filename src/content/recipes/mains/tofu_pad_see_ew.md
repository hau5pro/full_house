- 1 tsp _sesame oil_
- 1 tsp _crushed sea salt flakes_
- 1/4 tsp _white pepper_
- 1/2 tsp _Chinese five-spice powder_ (optional)
- 2 tbsp _cornstarch_

#### Pad See Ew

- 3 tbsp _peanut oil_ (or vegetable oil)
- 250 g dry _wide flat rice noodles_ (or 500 g fresh sen yai noodles)
- 2 tbsp _peanut oil_ (or grapeseed oil)
- 5 _garlic_ cloves, minced
- 4 stems _Chinese broccoli_ (gai lan), cut into bite-sized pieces
- 2 _eggs_, whisked
- 2 tbsp _light soy sauce_
- 2 tbsp _dark sweet soy sauce_ (kecap manis)
- 2 tbsp _oyster sauce_
- 2 tsp _fish sauce_
- 2 tbsp _coconut sugar_ (or _brown sugar_)
- 2 tbsp _water_
- _red chili flakes_ and _lime_ wedges, to serve

## Directions

1. Cook noodles per package instructions (see notes for noodle prep).
2. Toss tofu with sesame oil, salt, white pepper, five-spice, and cornstarch in a bowl.
3. Mix light soy sauce, dark sweet soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, sugar, and water in a small bowl.
4. Heat oil in a large wok on high. Add tofu and stir-fry 2-3 minutes, tossing constantly until golden.
5. Add garlic and stir-fry a few seconds. Add Chinese broccoli and stir-fry until greens are glossy.
6. Push everything to one side of the wok. Add whisked egg to the empty space and stir-fry, breaking it up as it cooks. Mix egg into the rest of the ingredients.
7. Add noodles and sauce. Toss constantly 3-4 minutes until thoroughly mixed and hot throughout.
8. Serve hot with crushed red chili flakes and lime wedges.

## Notes

- **Noodles:** Traditional pad see ew uses fresh wide rice noodles (sen yai). If unavailable, use dry pad Thai noodles or the widest flat rice sticks — soak in boiling water 4-5 minutes until softened, then drain. Fresh noodles just need a quick microwave to soften.
- **Vegetarian:** Substitute fish sauce with lime juice and oyster sauce with vegetarian oyster sauce or hoisin.
- **Vegan:** Skip the egg. Substitute fish sauce with lime juice and oyster sauce with vegetarian oyster sauce or hoisin.
- **Gluten-free:** Ensure all sauces used are gluten-free.
