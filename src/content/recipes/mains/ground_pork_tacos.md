## Ingredients

- 1 tsp _olive oil_
- 1 lb _ground pork_ (or _ground beef_)
- 1-2 tbsp [_taco seasoning_](/recipes/seasonings/ground_meat_taco_seasoning)
- 1/4 cup _water_ (can substitute broth)
- _salt_ to taste
- 8 _flour or corn tortillas_

_OPTIONAL TOPPINGS_

- shredded _cabbage_, see notes
- 1 large _avocado_, pitted and mashed
- 2 tbsp _sour cream_, see notes
- _pickled onions_
- _pico de gallo_
- _tomatillo salsa_
- _lime_, quartered

## Directions

#### PREPARE PORK

1. Heat a wide skillet over medium heat and add the oil. Press the pork flat into the pan and brown undisturbed for about 5 minutes.

2. Break into small crumbles with a wooden spoon. Cook until browned on all sides, about 3 minutes.

3. Toss with 1 tbsp taco seasoning. Taste and adjust — with homemade seasoning, use 2 tbsp.

4. Stir in the water and simmer until thickened and coating the pork. Season with salt if needed.

#### ASSEMBLE TACOS

1. Wrap tortillas in two foil-wrapped stacks and warm in a 350°F oven for 10-15 minutes.

2. Fill each tortilla with pork and toppings. Try mashed avocado on the bottom, then pork, cabbage, pickled onions, and sour cream.

## Notes

- **Cabbage:** Raw shredded cabbage works, but a cilantro lime coleslaw (lime, honey, olive oil dressing) is even better. Salt the cabbage before dressing for crunch.
- **Sour cream:** To drizzle, thin 2 tbsp sour cream with 1-2 tsp water or lime juice.
- **Make-ahead:** Pork keeps refrigerated up to 4 days. Reheat with a splash of water to moisten.
