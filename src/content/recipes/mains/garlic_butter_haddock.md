## Ingredients

- 4 _haddock fillets_
- 1 tbsp _olive oil_
- 1/2 tsp _onion powder_
- _salt_ and _black pepper_
- 3 tbsp _butter_
- 3 _garlic cloves_, crushed and peeled
- 4 sprigs fresh _oregano_
- _lemon wedges_, for serving

## Directions

1. Pat haddock fillets dry and season with onion powder, salt, and pepper.
2. Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.
3. Reduce heat to medium and place fillets in the skillet. Cook without moving for 2–3 minutes.
4. Gently flip fillets with two spatulas and cook 1 minute more.
5. Add butter, garlic, and oregano. Cook 30 seconds, then tilt the skillet to pool the butter and baste the fish repeatedly for 15 seconds. Lay the skillet flat and cook 1–2 minutes more.
6. Remove garlic and oregano sprigs. Top fillets with fresh oregano leaves, drizzle with pan butter, and serve with lemon wedges.

## Notes

- **Storage:** Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Use glass to avoid lingering odors.
- **Freezing:** Cool completely, then store in a freezer-safe container for up to 3 months.
- **Reheating:** Warm in a skillet over medium-low heat for the best texture.
