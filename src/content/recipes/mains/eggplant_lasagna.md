## Ingredients

- 2-3 large _eggplants_ (~4 lb), stemmed, sliced into 1/4-inch planks
- _sea salt_
- _extra-virgin olive oil_
- 9 _lasagna noodles_, cooked
- 2 cups grated _mozzarella_
- 1/4 cup grated _parmesan_
- _red pepper flakes_
- fresh _basil_ leaves

#### Marinara

- 2 _garlic_ cloves, minced
- 4 cups _passata_ (Mutti)
- 1 tsp _italian seasoning_

#### Filling

- 2 cups (16 oz) whole milk _ricotta_
- 1 large _egg_, beaten
- 1/4 cup grated _parmesan_
- 2 _garlic_ cloves, grated
- 1 tsp dried _oregano_
- 1 tsp _lemon zest_
- 1/2 tsp _sea salt_
- _black pepper_

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Simmer garlic, passata, and italian seasoning in a saucepan over low heat while you prep the rest.
2. Line three baking sheets with parchment paper and oil lightly. Arrange eggplant planks on kitchen towels, sprinkle with salt, and let sit 20 minutes.
3. Pat eggplant dry, transfer to baking sheets, and drizzle with olive oil. Roast 20-25 minutes until tender and golden, flipping halfway through.
4. Make the filling: stir together ricotta, egg, parmesan, garlic, oregano, lemon zest, salt, and pepper.
5. Oil a 9x13-inch baking dish and spread a thin layer of marinara on the bottom. Build 3 layers of: lasagna noodles, roasted eggplant, ricotta filling, and marinara. Top final layer with mozzarella and parmesan.
6. Cover with foil and bake 15 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 20 minutes until cheese is browned and bubbling. Let stand 30 minutes before slicing. Garnish with red pepper flakes and basil.

## Notes

- **Make Ahead:** Marinara and the assembled lasagna can both be prepared a day in advance. Refrigerate and add 5-10 minutes to bake time.
- **Storage:** Airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
