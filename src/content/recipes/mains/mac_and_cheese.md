## Ingredients

- 16 oz _elbow macaroni_, cooked (or other tubular pasta)
- 1 tbsp _extra virgin olive oil_
- 6 tbsp _unsalted butter_
- 1/3 cup _all-purpose flour_
- 3 cups _whole milk_
- 1 cup _heavy whipping cream_
- 4 cups _sharp cheddar cheese_, shredded
- 2 cups _gruyere cheese_, shredded
- _salt_ and _pepper_ to taste
- 1 1/2 cups _panko crumbs_
- 4 tbsp _butter_, melted
- 1/2 cup _parmesan cheese_, shredded
- 1/4 tsp _smoked paprika_ (or regular paprika)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly grease a 3-4 qt baking dish. Combine shredded cheeses in a large bowl.
2. Cook pasta one minute shy of al dente per package instructions. Drain and place in a large bowl.
3. Drizzle pasta with olive oil and stir to coat. Set aside to cool.
4. Melt butter in a deep saucepan or dutch oven over medium heat.
5. Whisk in flour and cook about 1 minute until bubbly and golden.
6. Gradually whisk in milk and cream until smooth. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then whisk another 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
7. Add cheese in two batches, whisking until smooth after each addition. Sauce should be thick and creamy.
8. Stir in cooled pasta until fully coated.
9. Pour half the mac and cheese into the baking dish. Top with remaining 2 cups shredded cheese, then add the rest of the mac and cheese.
10. Combine panko, parmesan, melted butter, and paprika. Sprinkle over top. Bake until bubbly and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- **Make Ahead:** Keeps well in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat covered at 350F.
- **Cheese Swap:** Fontina or monterey jack work well in place of gruyere.
