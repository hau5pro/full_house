## Ingredients

- 5 cups _sparkling water_
- 4 _lemons_
- 1/3 cup _agave_
- 2 cups _ice_

#### Garnish

- _lemon_ slices
- _mint_ leaves

## Directions

1. Juice 4 lemons into a pitcher. Add agave and stir to dissolve.
2. Pour in sparkling water and stir gently.

## Notes

**Substitution:** Use 1/2 cup sugar instead of agave — dissolve it in 1/2 cup warm water first to make a simple syrup, then cool before adding.
