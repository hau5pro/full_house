## Ingredients

- Eggs
- 1 teaspoon salt (optional)

## Directions

1. Place your eggs in a single layer on the bottom of your pot and cover with cold water. The water should be about an inch or so higher than the eggs. Cover the pot with a lid.

2. Over high heat, bring your eggs to a rolling boil.

3. Remove from heat and let stand in water for 10-12 minutes for large eggs. Reduce the time slightly for smaller eggs, and increase the standing time for extra-large eggs.

4. Drain water and immediately run cold water over eggs until cooled. Rapid cooling helps prevent a green ring from forming around the yolks.

## Notes

- For easiest peeling, use eggs that have been in the refrigerator the longest. The less fresh the egg, the easier it is to peel.
- To peel a hard boiled egg, crackle the shell all over by tapping the egg on a hard surface, then roll the egg between your hands to loosen the shell. Begin peeling at the large end. Hold the egg under cold running water or dip it in a bowl of water to help remove the shell.
- Hard boiled eggs with the shell on and kept in a sealed container will keep for 1 week in the fridge.
- To determine whether an egg is hard boiled or raw, spin it! If it spins round and round evenly, it is hard boiled. If it wobbles while spinning, it is a raw egg.
