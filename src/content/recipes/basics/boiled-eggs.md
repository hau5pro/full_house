## Ingredients

- 1 _egg_
- 1 tsp _salt_ (optional)

## Directions

1. Place eggs in a single layer in a pot. Cover with cold water by about an inch. Lid on.

2. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat.

3. Remove from heat and let stand 6-14 minutes (adjust slightly for egg size).

4. Drain and run cold water over eggs until cooled to prevent green rings on the yolks.

## Notes

- **Peeling:** Older eggs peel easier. Crack the shell all over, roll between your hands, and peel from the large end under running water.
- **Storage:** Keep shell-on in a sealed container for up to 1 week in the fridge.
- **Raw or cooked?** Spin it — hard boiled eggs spin smoothly, raw eggs wobble.
